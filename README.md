## My process

**I always start with looking into the design first so I can plan ahead and come up with a solution on how to tackle the project.**
**I usually look into different design to get inspirations and iterate through them, combine them, or add something to it.**

1. I built the structure of the project using HTML, adding all the necessary assets such as the stylesheet, scripts, fonts, or icons needed for the project.
2. After I created the markup I proceed on making the design.
3. After I'm done with the design, I proceed on working on the function of the component.s

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass preprocessor
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font-styles

### What I learned

With this project I added new things to my skills with HTML, SASS, and JS. I also had some fun using javascript libraries such as Swiper JS and learned how to capture data from a JSON file.

### Continued development

- When to use or not to use flexbox
- Sass
- Javascript
- DOM manipulation
