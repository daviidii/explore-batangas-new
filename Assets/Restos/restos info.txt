Casa Marikit Ristorante Italiano is an authentic Italian restaurant in Lipa City. Yes, there is a high-end Italian restaurant in Lipa City, and it offers one of the best Italian cuisine experiences this part of the country.

It’s the lovechild and the very first project of the husband and wife team of TJ and Michelle Fabie. Named after their daughter, Marikit, it’s a family-friendly restaurant thanks to its casual dining setting.

Casa Marikit has always been our go-to place in the city whenever there’s a special occasion. We’ve celebrated Valentine’s Day, birthdays, Mother’s Day and more here, and we’ve always had an amazing experience.

3. D'Ursi Pizza Autentica Pizzeria Napoletana

Details
The kitchen of D’ursi is headed by Chef Matteo D’ursi. Yes, the restaurant is named after him and rightfully so. Italian food is only as good as the cooks and chefs cooking it. You can’t fake it. With Chef Matteo tracing his roots to Italy and having more than a decade of experience cooking Italian food (he had his own Italian restaurant back home in Italy), the result is authentic Italian food.

Fortunately, they joined us for dinner, and it was one of the highlights of our visit. They’re nice people and are very knowledgeable. We learned a lot!
